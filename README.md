NBA Weekly:

What is NBAWeekly?
  FOMO on latest basketball clips and news because of a busy work schedule? No problem here is the weekly scrapper which get's us the trending videos from youtube and 
  helps not to miss out on any NBA clips. It notifies through mail about the weekly NBA trending clips in a beautiful table.
  I am an Indian citizen and hence face various problems due to the NBA matches being conducted occur at a very unusual time and hence I miss out on a lot of NBA 
  matches. To overcome such an issue and implement my selenium skills in order to find a solution, I created this scraper bot.
 
Here's a sample mail recieved by the bot:

How to use this bot?
  We can schedule a task on our own device using the task scheduler for weekly basis. Create a bat file for the 'run.py' script and set a weeekly task on the task         scheduler.
  
  Another way to host it live is by deploying it in the AWS and create an AWS lambda function to trigger it by adding the python and the webdriver layer. Create a API
  Gateway trigger function and it's done.
